                    <p>Hi! I'm a software engineering professional with a keen interest in process automation, 
                        fullstack development and possessing an eye for visual design. My major working areas are 
                        Python-based backend development, automation and data engineering with Google Cloud. I 
                        also like to work with fullstack development and I'm taking this forward with Django
                        and the MERN stack.

                            Having worked with JavaScript and Python over the course of my academic and professional life, I've often
                            used them in the context of web-oriented engineering tasks. Currently I am working on my Django skills to round
                            out the backend experience in a full stack approach. On the frontend, I have a reasonable grip on responsive design 
                            and I'm looking to master the MERN stack.

                            Due to my electrical engineering background, I've had ample exposure to embedded hardware and Internet connected
                            IoT systems. I've worked on projects across the pipeline of IoT devices, from data capture, through communications to 
                            serving data on the frontend for users. My experience consists of proprietary embedded hardware as well as commercial,
                            off-the-shelf hardware such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards. I've also worked on pub/sub communications models 
                            and hardware-software integrations. Currently, my main interest in working on making sensor-based data useful for users
                            in a data engineering and web development context.

                            <p>
                               This project involved the development of a machine learning model to recognize an array of human activities
                               from timeseries sensor data obtained from mobile phones. Common, daily physical activities such as walking, jogging, climbing,
                               sitting etc. were included. The model used was an ensemble network of multiple convolutional neural networks. This approach was used
                               in order to combine the best features of multiple models and in order to forego the heuristic development of features as with
                               a more traditional model. The project resulted in a research publication which can be found here:

                            <p>
                                One of the challenges encountered at work was debugging errors enocuntered in server-side 
                                Google Tag Manager (GTM). GTM is a tool that allows the management of tags or snippets of code used
                                in websites for marketing purposes. Sometimes, certain tags would not register and it was often difficult 
                                for analysts to decipher the errors without any means of viewing the particulars of the requests which raised the
                                errors. The solution implemented involved setting up a serverless Cloud Function that parses particular requests 
                                with an extra token in the header. This token was compared against an existing one and subsequently, the request 
                                data was logged into a Google Cloud Storage bucket. The technologies involved in this project included JavaScript, 
                                Python, Google BigQuery and Google Cloud Functions.
